Cryptocurrency Trading Bot with LSTM and Portfolio Optimization
Project Description
This project implements an advanced cryptocurrency trading bot that leverages machine learning and portfolio optimization techniques to automate trading decisions across multiple cryptocurrency assets. The bot integrates deep learning models (LSTM) for price prediction with technical indicators and modern portfolio theory to generate trading signals and optimize asset allocation.
Key Features

Multi-Asset Trading: Supports trading across multiple cryptocurrencies simultaneously (currently implemented for BTC, ETH, and BNB)
LSTM Price Prediction: Uses Long Short-Term Memory neural networks to forecast cryptocurrency price movements
Bollinger Bands Strategy: Implements a Bollinger Bands-based trading strategy with dynamic take-profit and stop-loss levels
Portfolio Optimization: Utilizes Markowitz portfolio optimization with quadratic programming to allocate assets based on predicted returns and risk
Performance Metrics: Calculates Sharpe ratio and other performance indicators to evaluate trading strategy effectiveness
Backtesting Framework: Includes a comprehensive backtesting system to evaluate the strategy before deploying with real funds
Visualization Tools: Generates trading performance charts and signal visualization
Binance API Integration: Connects to Binance exchange for real-time data and trading (requires API keys)

Technical Implementation
The bot integrates several sophisticated components:

Sequential LSTM neural networks with dual layers for time-series prediction
Technical indicators including Bollinger Bands for trade timing
Convex optimization for portfolio weight determination
Risk-adjusted performance measurement
Dynamic position sizing based on market conditions
Adaptive weight adjustment based on trading performance

Results
In backtesting, the strategy demonstrates:

Positive overall returns across multiple cryptocurrency assets
Reasonable Sharpe ratio indicating good risk-adjusted performance
Effective identification of entry and exit points using LSTM predictions and Bollinger Bands
Dynamic portfolio rebalancing based on changing market conditions

Disclaimer
This trading bot is provided for educational and research purposes only. Cryptocurrency trading involves significant risk of loss. Past performance of the strategy does not guarantee future results. Always perform your own due diligence before trading with real funds.
